#  Tests to write:
#  √ move player 1
#  √ move player 2
#  √ player 1 can't play if it's player 2's turn
#  √ player 2 can't play if it's player 1's turn
#  √ move counter increments after each turn
#  √ hits are recorded to damage the fleet
#  √ misses do not damage the fleet
#  √ if player 1 destroys player 2's fleet, player 2 has one last shot from her remaining fleet (as if players fired simultaneously)
#  √ if player 2 destroys player 1's fleet, player 1 does not have another go because he already went that round.
#  √ once all players have shot that winning round, game terminates and no more shots are accepted.
#  √ if both players sink each others' fleets in the same round, game status is a tie
